                <h1>Ã‰variste Galois</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Galois was a prominent mathematician in the early-19th century, who is credited with popularizing the current group-theoretic perspective on field theory, the solvibility of polynomials in radicals, and (obviously) Galois theory.</p>
                <p>He was born on the 25th of October, 1811, and died shortly after in May of 1832. He died in a duel with a artillery officer, who was involved in Galois' prior arrest due to involvement with the French revolutionary efforts.</p>
